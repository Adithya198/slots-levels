Slots Levels â€” Quantitative Slot Machine Simulation and Strategy Analysis
This project implements a customizable slot machine game engine with an innovative "progress bar" mechanic that influences bonus triggers and player rewards over multiple rounds. Unlike typical slot games, this design incorporates:

Dynamic bar-fill mechanics based on matching symbol combinations

Upgradable player strategies affecting spins, probabilities, and rewards

Simulation of various play policies including baseline, aggressive, conservative, and adaptive AI

Rich statistical analysis and export of spin probabilities, expected returns, and game balance metrics

The goal is to demonstrate quantitative modeling and simulation expertise applied to game math, showcasing skills in probabilistic modeling, strategy optimization, and data-driven decision making
